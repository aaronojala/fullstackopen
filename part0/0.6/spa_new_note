The SPA version of the app does not send the form data in the traditional way, 
but instead uses the JavaScript code it fetched from the server. 
end note

Code determines that the data is to be sent with an HTTP POST request 
and the data type is to be JSON. The data type is determined with a Content-type header. 
Then the data is sent as JSON-string.
